Known Bugs:

- When the player grows with big boned powerup collisions get screwed, sometimes the player will slide through breakable bricks.

- Ninja Jumping glitches sometimes and the character will climb walls automatically.

- All maps from the third level onward are using a new version of the tile editor, so they won't load assets on the first try. They will trigger an exception and the user must accept it.

- Some Platforms go beyond where they should. They still return.
